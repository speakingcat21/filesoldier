            },
            {
                "question": "How long are my files stored?",
                "answer": "Files are stored based on the expiration time you choose during upload. You can set expiration from 1 hour up to 7 days. After expiration, files are automatically and permanently deleted from our servers."
            },
            {
                "question": "Is my data secure?",
                "answer": "Absolutely. All files are encrypted using AES-256 encryption directly in your browser before being uploaded. This means your files are encrypted before they ever leave your device, and only someone with the correct password can decrypt them. We never see your unencrypted data."
            },
            {
                "question": "Can I password protect my files?",
                "answer": "Yes, and we highly recommend it! You can set a password during upload. The recipient will need to enter this password to download and decrypt the file. For maximum security, share the password through a different channel than the download link."
            },
            {
                "question": "What is a download limit?",
                "answer": "You can set a maximum number of downloads for each file. Once the limit is reached, the file can no longer be downloaded. This is useful for ensuring your file is only accessed a specific number of times."
            },
            {
                "question": "What file types can I upload?",
                "answer": "You can upload any file type. FileSoldier doesn't restrict file types, but please ensure you have the rights to share any content you upload and that it complies with our terms of service."
            },
            {
                "question": "What happens if I forget the password?",
                "answer": "Due to our zero-knowledge encryption, we cannot recover your password or decrypt your files. If you forget the password, the file is unrecoverable. Please store your passwords safely."
